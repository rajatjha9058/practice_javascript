    “With so many different marketing and sales platforms 
    available to companies, <br>it's no wonder that marketers are turning to
     artificial intelligence (AI) to help them manage their campaigns. 
    <br><u>AI can help create more effective campaigns by bringing together all</u>
     <br>the different aspects of a campaign, from customer segmentation <br>to 
    media and creative optimization to automating follow -up emails and messages.
    <br> In a similar way, sales teams are using AI tools to close more<br>
     deals by using machine learning to understand what makes each lead or account unique,
     <br>allowing sales reps to go back-and-forth with prospects in ways that will be most effective for them.
    <br> By using AI tools like these, companies can streamline their<br> processes and experience better results.”</h3></p> </section></main>

            <p>The Birth of AI: 1950-1956
                This was the time when interest in AI really peaked. Alan Turing published his work "Computer Machinery
                and
                Intelligence" which eventually became the Turing Test, used by experts to measure computer intelligence.
                The
                term "artificial intelligence" was coined and came into popular usage.</p>
